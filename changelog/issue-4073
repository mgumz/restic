Enhancement: Deduce --dry-mode from environment variable RESTIC_DRY_MODE

# Describe the problem in the past tense, the new behavior in the present
# tense. Mention the affected commands, backends, operating systems, etc.
# Focus on user-facing behavior, not the implementation.

Various commands support the --dry-run flag. When restic is used as part of a
scripted chain, adding/removing "--dry-run" to check the chain is tedious.
This enhancement introduces the evaluation of the environment variable
RESTIC_DRY_RUN. If set, "--dry-run=true" is assumed. It applies to commands
"backup", "forget", "prune" and "rewrite".

The system-wide bar is still the default.
